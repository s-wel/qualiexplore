This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `https://localhost:4200`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## JSON-Server
A mock json-server backend is used to build this project. This backend is used for CRUD operations on Filters page and generate editable tree for Factors data. Data are stored in `db.json` file. Rest of the things are handeled by GraphQl server.
